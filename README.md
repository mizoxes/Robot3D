# Robot3D Client

(Feel free to contact me on my discord (darkaich777) if you are interested about the Mizo3D library source code)

This project uses Mizo3D, a 3d library built on top of OpenGL to abstract repetitive work such as window creation, animated model loading, collision detection, graphics rendering etc.

Multiple players can connect to a server using its IP address and port number and see each other in the same virtual world.
